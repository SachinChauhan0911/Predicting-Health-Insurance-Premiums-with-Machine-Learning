# Predicting-Health-Insurance-Premiums-with-Machine-Learning
This project leverages machine learning to address these challenges by predicting health insurance costs based on individual attributes, such as age, medical history, and lifestyle factors. By creating a model tailored to individual risk profiles, insurers can set fair and precise premiums that reflect each personâ€™s specific health characteristics.
